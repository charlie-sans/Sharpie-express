Sharpie is a 16-bit fantasy console implemented in C#. It is a powerhouse designed to get in your way as little as possible while mimicking how old NES- and SNES-era games were programmed. It features its own custom Assembly language that facilitates most of what you'd need to not pull your hair out in the process of making a game, as well as support for C.

### what is sharpie-express

sharpie-express is a port of sharpie to Stardust by Finite.
mostly containing the origional setup, it features extra ram, higher register count and 
increased audio channels provided by Stardust's audio system.

to use sharpie on it's own, you can download builds for sharpie from the origional repository [here](https://github.com/ChristosMaragkos/Sharpie)

go, have fun!
